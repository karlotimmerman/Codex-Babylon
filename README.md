# Babylex

This project converts natural language into 3D assets using [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and OpenAI's [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/). Currently it is a basic web application with an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) backend.

## Requirements

- Node.JS
- Open AI API Key to make API calls against Codex

## Running the App

1. `git clone` the repo: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Babylex` and open the Babylex folder
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, copying the contents of the `.env.example` file
3. Add the Open AI API Key and the port you want to run the app to the .env file. The port is optional, and defaults to 1018
4. Run `npm install` to gather the projects' dependencies
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Run `node app.js` to start the server
7. Open the app in the browser (ex: [localhost](http://localhost:1018/))

## Using the App

The app consists of a basic text box to enter natural language commands, and a 3D scene to display the results. Enter commands into the text box and press enter to see the results. Note that conversation context is maintained between commands, so subsequent commands can refer back to previous ones.

Example commands:

  > _Create a cube_

  > _Make it red and make it spin_

  >_Put a teal sphere above it and another below it_

  > _Make the bottom sphere change colors when the cursor hovers over it_

## Debugging

The current debugging experience is basic:
 - Observe logs in your browser dev tools (F12) to debug issues evaluating generated code
 - Observe logs in your console to debug issues between the Express server, Codex and the client

## Understand the Code

- `app.js` is the main entry point for the app. It sets up the Express serves and serves the client
- `model.js` manages interaction the Codex API. This uses `isomorphic-fetch` to make POST calls of natural language to be converted to code. It also includes helper methods for engineering the prompt that is sent to Codex (see "prompt engineering" below)
- `index.html` is the barebones main view of the app. It uses Bootstrap for basic styling

## Prompt Engineering

Generative models like Codex are trained on the simple task of guessing the next token in a sequence. A good practice to coax the kind of tokens (code) you want from Codex is to include example interactions in a prompt. These examples are sent to the model with every API call, along with your natural language query. Codex then "guesses" the next tokens in the sequence (the code that satisfies the natural language).

This project contains various prompts to elicit different kinds of code from the model. These prompts live in `./prompts` and are loaded by the `model.js` file. Currently the project uses `./prompts/prompt1.js` as the default. As users interact with the app, the prompt is updated to reflect the "conversation history". This enables pronount resolution (e.g. of "it" in "make it red") on future conversation turns. It also makes the model aware of any variables that may have been instantiated, that it may need to reference on future inferences.

Currently a single ongoing prompt is maintained on the server. This can be reset with the "Reset" button in the app. The single prompt means that the app is currently not multi-tenanted, and that multiple browser instances will reuse the same prompt.
